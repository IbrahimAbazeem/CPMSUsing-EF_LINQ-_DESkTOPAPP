🚀 Construction Project Management System (CPMS)
I’m excited to share my project, CPMS, designed to help engineering companies manage construction projects by tracking project status, teams, and progress.
🎯 Core Features:
Add, update, and delete projects while assigning teams.
Manage project status (Prepare, In Progress, Completed).
Search projects by name or status.
🛠️ Implementation Steps:
Designed the database using Entity Framework (Code-First).
Built the user interface with Windows Forms.
Implemented CRUD operations and search using LINQ.
Applied OOP principles to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase.
📚 Technologies Used:
C#, LINQ, Entity Framework
Windows Forms
SQL Database
This project brings together concepts from Database, C#, OOP, and LINQ courses. It’s just the beginning, and I’m motivated to continue learning and growing in this field.
